# Project-ARTE
A Portfolio Website based on the computer terminals of old. At first, taken inspiration from modern art museums, all was swell until the UI itself. It looked bad, no museum should have a bad-looking UI Let alone a digital one. Then I remember myself from a few weeks back, downloading and playing MARATHON by Bungie (1999), and inspiration struck.
